## Proposed Project ideas

### Armada

#### Build a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada

- Description: [Virtual Kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet) is a way to bring a Kubernetes front end and allow for your execution environment to be something other than Kubernetes. We want to add a virtual-kubelet provider for Armada so we can allow for a k8 front end integration with Armada.
- Expected outcomes:
  - A provider for virtual-kubelet that allows integration of Armada with Virtual-Kubelet
- Recommend Skills: Go

### Konveyor

#### Extend use-case of detecting deprecated Kubernetes API usage

- Description: [Konveyor](https://www.konveyor.io/) provides a [unified experience](https://github.com/konveyor/enhancements/tree/master/enhancements/unified_experience) of tools to help organizations modernize their applications at scale to Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. We are looking for help on extending a use-case of detecting usage of [deprecated and removed Kubernetes APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/) in applications.  This work will involve determining what API resources have been deprecated or removed in each version of Kubernetes and then building [Analyzer Rules](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/rules.md) to be contributed to our [Rulesets repository](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets), curation or development of sample applications in Golang, Java, and YAML to aid test scenarios, and documentation to help show a guided walkthrough of this capability.  You can see the beginning of this use-case being addressed with a [sample rule](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/rule-example.yaml#L42-L45) in this [demo of analyzer-lsp](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/tree/main#quick-demo). The development environment is based on Golang and Kubernetes. A minikube instance will work well for local development on Linux or Mac systems.
- Expected Outcome:
  - [Rules](https://github.com/konveyor/analyzer-lsp/blob/main/docs/rules.md) contributed to [konveyor/rulesets](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets) to detect usage of deprecated or removed Kubernetes APIs.  Coverage for YAML, Golang, and Java source code, addition of this scenario into the project's automated test suite, and documentation of a guided scenario showing usage of these rules via a curated set of application source code examples.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Go
  - Basic understanding of interaction with Kubernetes via kubectl
  - Basic software development skills (command line, git)

#### Move2Kube: Compile Move2Kube to WASM/WASI and run it in the browser

- Description: Move2Kube is a command-line tool for automating creation of Infrastructure as code (IaC) artifacts. It has inbuilt support for creating IaC artifacts for replatforming to Kubernetes/OpenShift. We want to compile targetting WASM/WASI and run the resulting WASM module in the browser. This will help up showcase Move2Kube for demos and allow users to quickly try out Move2Kube without having to install it or any of its dependencies.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Run Move2Kube CLI in the browser using WebAssembly.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - WASM

#### Move2Kube: WASM Transformers

- Description: Move2Kube is a command-line tool for automating creation of Infrastructure as code (IaC) artifacts. It has inbuilt support for creating IaC artifacts for replatforming to Kubernetes/OpenShift. Move2Kube has a very plugin friendly architecture, users can write custom logic in the form of "Transformers" that Move2Kube can integrate seamlessly into its transformation pipeline. So far we have support for both Starlark and container image based transformers. We would like to support writing transformers as WASM modules that Move2Kube can run. WASM provides extensive sandboxing for security, it allows writing transformers in different language stacks like Rust, C/C++, etc. other than Golang, and WASM is just as lightweight and fast as Starlark.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Implement a feature in Move2Kube CLI to allow running WASM modules as custom transformers.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - WASM

#### Move2Kube: Advanced Resources support - ArgoCD, Tekton, Stateful Set, etc.

- Description: Move2Kube is a command-line tool for automating creation of Infrastructure as code (IaC) artifacts. It has inbuilt support for creating IaC artifacts for replatforming to Kubernetes/OpenShift. Currently we have rudimentary support for resources such as ArgoCD, Tekton, etc. We need to enhance this to make it useful. Example: https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube/issues/930
- Expected Outcome:
  - More comprehensive support for advanced K8s resources so as to support real world use cases.
- Recommended Skills:
  - Golang
  - K8s
  - ArgoCD
  - Tekton
